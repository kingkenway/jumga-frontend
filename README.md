### Introduction
Project Jumga is a Full stack application, powered with Vue.js as the frontend and [Django as the backend](https://github.com/kingkenway/jumga/).
It is a payment system powered by flutterwave, to help Merchants grow their businesses with ease.

### Overview
Firstly, a Merchant signups up for free, afterwards he is able to create as many shops as possible with $20 each.  
Upon payment confirmation, the shop is assigned a rider automatically and also allowed to add products to his/her shop and can also go Live instantly.
Also, when a user signs up, he is faced with a selection box to pick any country of his choice between Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and the United Kingdom.
Whatever country that is been picked becomes the base currency for his/her shop and its products.  

Once the products of an approved shop is listed by the merchant, such shop can be viewed live for his customers to make purchases and do good business.
  
An Admin Merchant account has been created for Jumga already, with the following credentials: Email: "jumga@gmail.com", Password: "aaaassss".
It is through this account that all earnings from the proceeds of Shop Approvals, Commision from Sales and Commision from Delivery are being remitted.  
  
From the MVP requirements, no commission ratio was stated for Sales and Delivery, thus the following commission from the given example in the MVP requirements, with the workings at the end of this README, was shared as follows:  

```
### Sales
MERCHANT'S COMMISSION ON SALE = 97.4%  
JUMGA'S COMMISSION ON SALE = 2.6%  
### Delivery
RIDER'S DELIVERY COMMISSION = 80%  
JUMGA'S DELIVERY COMMISSION = 20%  
```
