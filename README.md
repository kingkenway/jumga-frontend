# Flutterwave Developer Challenge (J.U.M.G.A)

### Introduction
[Project Jumga](https://jumgaapp.netlify.app/) is a Full stack application, powered with VueJS as the frontend and [Django as the backend](https://github.com/kingkenway/jumga/).
It is a payment system powered by flutterwave, to help Merchants grow their businesses with ease.

### Overview
Firstly, a Merchant [signs up](https://jumgaapp.netlify.app/signup/merchant) for free, afterwards he is able to create as many shops as possible for as low as $20 each on approval. This amount is credited instantly to JUMGA'S account.  


Upon payment confirmation, the shop is assigned a rider automatically and also allowed to add products to his/her shop and can also go Live instantly for customers to run their transactions.
Also, when a Merchant signs up, he is faced with a selection box to pick any country of his choice between Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and the United Kingdom.
Whatever country that is picked becomes the base currency for his/her shop and its products.  

Once the products of an approved shop is listed by the merchant, such shop can be viewed live for customers to checkout, make purchases and do good business.
Also Merchants can view all available orders, whether paid or cancelled on his dashboard.  
  
An Admin Merchant account has been created for JUMGA already, with the following credentials: Email: "jumga@gmail.com", Password: "aaaassss".
It is through this account that all earnings from the proceeds of Shop Approvals, Commision from Sales and Commision from Delivery are being remitted.  
  
From the MVP requirements, no commission ratio was stated for Sales and Delivery, thus the following commission from the given example in the MVP requirements, was assumed, and was shared as follows:  

```
### Sales
MERCHANT'S COMMISSION ON SALE = 97.4%  
JUMGA'S COMMISSION ON SALE = 2.6%  
### Delivery
RIDER'S DELIVERY COMMISSION = 80%  
JUMGA'S DELIVERY COMMISSION = 20%  
```
  
### Cont'd
Through this [link](https://jumgaapp.netlify.app/admin/transactions), Jumga as the sovereign will be able to view every single transaction on the database, alongside with all of Jumga's earnings and also every single order on the database.
